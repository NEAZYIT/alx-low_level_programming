this repository contains several functions that perform different tasks using loops and conditional statements.

Function Descriptions : 

1 ) _isupper : int _isupper(int c); 
This function takes a character as an argument and returns 1 if it is uppercase and 0 otherwise.

2 ) _isdigit : int _isdigit(int c);
This function takes a character as an argument and returns 1 if it is a digit (0-9) and 0 otherwise.

3 ) mul : int mul(int a, int b);
This function takes two integers as arguments and returns their product.

4 ) print_numbers :void print_numbers(void);
This function prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. It can only use _putchar function twice.

5 ) print_most_numbers : void print_most_numbers(void);
This function prints the numbers from 0 to 9, followed by a new line, except for 2 and 4. It can only use _putchar function twice.

6 ) more_numbers : void more_numbers(void);
This function prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times, followed by a new line. It can only use _putchar function three times.

7 ) print_line : void print_line(int n);
This function draws a straight line in the terminal using the character _. The number of times the character _ is printed is determined by the argument n. If n is 0 or less, the function only prints a new line.

8 ) print_diagonal : void print_diagonal(int n);
This function draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the character \. The number of times the character \ is printed is determined by the argument n. If n is 0 or less, the function only prints a new line.

9 ) print_square : void print_square(int size);
This function prints a square in the terminal using the character #. The size of the square is determined by the argument size. If size is 0 or less, the function only prints a new line.

10 ) fizzbuzz : void fizzbuzz(void);
This program prints the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz". Each number or word is separated by a space.

11 ) print_triangle : void print_triangle(int size);
This function prints a triangle in the terminal using the character #. The size of the triangle is determined by the argument size. If size is 0 or less, the function only prints a new line.

All the functions were implemented using loops and conditional statements. The putchar function was used to print characters on the terminal.
