OVERVIEW :
In this project, we will learn how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in C.

REQUIREMETNS :

All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags:

.-Wall
.-Werror
.-Wextra
.-pedantic
.-std=gnu89

0-binary_to_uint.c
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1-print_binary.c
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3-set_bit.c
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

4-clear_bit.c
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

5-flip_bits.c
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
