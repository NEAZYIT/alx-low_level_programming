This repository contains C programs that demanstrate the sue of function pointers.

TASKS:

0. Write a function that prints a name
1. Write a function that executes a function given as aparameter on each element of an array
2. Write a function that searches for an  integer
3. Write a program that  performs simple operation.The progam performs the operation indicated by  the operator on twi  integers, and prints the result to  the standard output.

The program  is divided into 4 files:
"3-calc.h": contains function prototypes and data stuctures used by the program

"3-op_functions.c": contains the functions that perform the defferent operation.

"3-get_op_func.c": contains a function thar  selects the correct function to  perform the operation asked by the user 

"3-main.c": contains the main function thar reads the arguments from the  comd, calls the apprpriates function to perform the operation, and prints the result to the standard output.
