Debugging Task README
This project involves debugging some code to fix issues and ensure that the code functions correctly. The code is designed to perform a specific task, but it is currently encountering errors that prevent it from running as intended. As such, the primary goal of this task is to identify and resolve these errors to ensure that the code functions correctly.

To run and test the code, follow these steps:

Install any necessary dependencies, such as libraries or frameworks, using the instructions provided in the project documentation.
Navigate to the code directory and open the relevant files in your preferred code editor.
Follow the instructions in the code comments to ensure that the code is properly configured and ready to run.
Use the provided test cases to verify that the code functions correctly and produces the expected output.
Throughout the debugging process, I will be documenting my progress and sharing any insights or challenges that arise. This may include discussing my thought process, outlining my debugging strategies, or highlighting any relevant code changes or optimizations.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving the code, please don't hesitate to submit a bug report or pull request. Your contributions and feedback are greatly appreciated and can help improve the quality of the project.
