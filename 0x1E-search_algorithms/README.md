# Search Algorithms in C

## Description
This project implements various search algorithms in C, offering a comprehensive understanding and implementation of each algorithm's logic. Included algorithms:

- Linear search: Sequentially searches for a value in an array.
- Binary search: Efficiently locates a value in a sorted array by halving the search space.
- Jump search: An optimized variant of linear search for larger arrays.
- Interpolation search: Estimates element position based on its value distribution.
- Exponential search: Rapidly narrows down the search space using exponential jumps.
- Advanced binary search: Locates the first occurrence of a value in a sorted array.
- Jump search for linked lists: Implements jump search specifically for singly linked lists.
