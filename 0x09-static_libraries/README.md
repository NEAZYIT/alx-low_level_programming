Static Library in C
This project demonstrates how to create and use a static library in a C program. The library libmy.a contains several functions that can be used in a C program.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need a C compiler and a text editor. You can either code all the functions listed in the task or create empty ones with the right prototypes.

Creating a Static Library
To create a static library in C, you can follow these steps:

Write the source code for the functions you want to include in the library. This code should be saved in separate .c files.

Compile the source code into object files using the C compiler. This can be done using the following command:

gcc -c function1.c function2.c ...

This will create object files for each of the source files.

Create the static library using the ar command:

ar rcs libmy.a function1.o function2.o ...

This will create a static library called libmy.a that contains the object files for all of the functions you want to include.

Using the Static Library
To use the static library in your program, you can link your program with the library and include the appropriate header file in your source code.

Here's an example:

Create a C source file for your program (e.g. main.c) and include the header file for the library functions you want to use. The header file typically contains function prototypes and other declarations needed to use the library functions.
#include "main.h"

int main() {
    // Call the library function
    _puts("\"At the end of the day, my goal was to be the best hacker\"\n\t- N");

    return 0;
}
Compile your program source file (main.c) and link it with the static library (libmy.a) using the C compiler. You will need to specify the path to the library file using the -L option, and the name of the library file (without the .a extension) using the -l option.
gcc main.c -L. -lmy -o myprogram
This command will compile main.c, link it with libmy.a, and generate an executable program called myprogram.

Run the program by typing ./myprogram in the terminal. This will call the _puts() function from the static library.
Note that the specific options and file names may vary depending on your specific project and build system. Also, make sure that the header file for the library is included in your source code and that the function names and argument types match those declared in the header file.
