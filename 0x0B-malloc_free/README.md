README
This repository contains solutions to several tasks related to memory allocation using malloc and free in the C programming language.

Tasks
create_array: This function creates an array of characters and initializes each element with a specific character.

_strdup: This function returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

str_concat: This function concatenates two strings and returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory.

alloc_grid: This function returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers with each element initialized to 0.

free_grid: This function frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by alloc_grid.
