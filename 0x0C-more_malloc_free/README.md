0-malloc_checked.c: A C function that allocates memory using malloc. If malloc fails, the function terminates the process with an exit status of 98.
1-string_nconcat.c: A C function that concatenates two strings. The function returns a pointer to a newly allocated memory block containing the concatenated strings.
2-calloc.c: A C function that allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each, and initializes the memory to zero. The function returns a pointer to the allocated memory block.
3-array_range.c: A C function that creates an array of integers containing all the values from min to max, inclusive.
